#
# Set up an action to monitor Contributor License Agreements (CLAs).
# See: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cla-assistant-lite
#
# 1) Signature branch creation
# By default this action is configured to output *******
# The branch containing the signatures must not be protected.  To create an empty branch named "cla-signatures" to contain the siguatures run:
# git checkout --orphan cla-signatures
# git rm -rf .
# git commit --allow-empty -m "CLA signature branch creation"
#
# 2) PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
#
# A personal access token must be set up to allow this bot to commit.  To do this:
# a) Create a personal access token with repo scope
# b) Add the token to the repository's secrets as PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
#
# 3) allowlist
#
# If a GitHub username is included in the allowlist, they will not be required to sign the CLA.  This is useful for allowing bots to contribute without a CLA.
